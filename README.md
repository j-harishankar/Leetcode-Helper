## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```
+---------------------+            +------------------------------+             +-----------------------------+
|  Chrome Extension   |  <------>  |  Django REST API (Render.com)|  <------->  | Large Language Model (LLM)  |
| (popup.html/js)     |            |   Endpoint: /api/solve/      |             | (Gemini, OpenAI, etc.)      |
+---------------------+            +------------------------------+             +-----------------------------+
       |                                                                                  |
       |------------------- User initiates a request -------------------------------------|
```

- **Frontend:** Presents popup UI, grabs problem info, and renders Markdown via marked.js.
- **Backend:** 
  The backend is built with Django and Django REST Framework, deployed on [Render.com](https://render.com) for seamless scalability and reliability. It exposes a single endpoint at `/api/solve/` and handles communication with the LLM.
- **LLM:** Generates step-by-step guidance tailored to the problem context.

---

### Key Backend Features

- **Integration with LLMs:** Utilizes APIs from LLM providers (e.g., Gemini, OpenAI) to generate detailed solutions and explanations.
- **Markdown Output:** Formats responses in Markdown for easy rendering on the frontend.
- **Error Handling:** Returns user-friendly error messages and backend status codes if the AI cannot generate guidance.
- **Scalability:** Hosted on Render.com for auto-scaling and high availability.
- **Security:** Basic request validation and sanitization are performed to ensure safe API usage.
- **Production Ready:** Includes Procfile and render.yaml for cloud deployment, and `.gitignore` for environment management.
- **Extensible:** Modular structure for easy addition of endpoints or support for other coding platforms.

> The backend is fully managed—no user setup required. All requests are handled securely and efficiently in the cloud.
